## Proposal

### What problem does your app solve? 
Finding more songs you might not
otherwise find in the app. 
Avoid unnecessary recommendations on your
home-page in the app.

### Be as specific as possible how does your app solve the problem?
Implement a Neural Network to do a classification on song features.

### What is the mission statement? 
Help users find and visualize songs that
fit their personal taste.

## Features

### What features are required for your minimum viable product? 
Build a modelto recommend songs based on history or picked song, and create visuals to
highlight differences between recommendations. Creating a user input form to get
predictionsand a page for user’s saved and favorite songs as well as user
registration.

### What features may you wish to put in a future release? 
See user’s favorite songs, Group songs into playlists and folders (by the user). **
Playlists by suggestor.  Filter personal favorites by genre, artist, ect 
Song ranking after listening.  Thumbs-downing songs you dislike to re-work the
suggestion.

 ### What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?  
Pandora, Shazam, Spotify Radio Function.  These allow users to listen to music they know, but
they limit discoverability, We want to allow more customization in song
generation, and have more sociability in user’s creations. IE Playlists.

## Frameworks - Libraries

 ### What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you using?  
Node, Yup, Spotipy,  Flask,  React,
Redux, Heroku, Docker, Tensorflow, axios.

## Prototype Key Features

 ### How long do you think it will take to implement these features? 
  2-3 days, 4th day for debugging 
 ### Do you anticipate working on stretch functionality after completion of a Minimal Viable Product?  
 Most likely.
